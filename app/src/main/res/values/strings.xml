    <string name="water_fact_1">We drink very little of our drinking water. Generally speaking,
        less than 1\%% of the treated water produced by water utilities is actually consumed. The
        rest goes on lawns, in washing machines, and down toilets and drains.</string>

        of Water Conservation.” http://www.co.maui.hi.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/4334.</string>
    <string name="water_fact_2">If everyone in the United States could manage to use just one less
        gallon of water per shower every day, we could save some 85 billion gallons per year.
        How do you do it? By keeping the shower pressure lower or by making your showers a few
        seconds shorter.</string>

    <string name="water_fact_3">If you have a lawn, chances are it\'s your biggest water gobbler.
        Typically, at least 50\%% of water consumed by households is used outdoors. Inside your house,
        bathroom facilities claim nearly 75\%% of the water used.</string>

    <string name="water_fact_4">It takes a considerable amount of energy to deliver and treat the
        water you use every day. For example, letting your faucet run for five minutes uses about as
        much energy as letting a 60-watt light bulb run for 22 hours.</string>

        products, homes and programs. These water efficient options provide the same performance and

    <string name="water_fact_7">Heating water for bathing, shaving, cooking, and cleaning also
        requires a lot of energy. Homes with electric water heaters, for example, spend one-quarter

    <string name="why_waste_less_1"><b>Wasting less is for you if you&#8230;\n
        -  want to help the environment\n
        -  want to save money\n
        -  want to help less-fortunate people in the world</b></string>
    <string name="why_waste_less_2">We\'ve all heard how our waste contributes to the environment
        being less  healthy, and it makes sense that we can save money when we use less resources,
        especially gasoline and water. But there\'s a different reason why your decreased usage can
        <b>impact many lives in the world</b> - but it takes one more step. Once you\'ve saved money by
        conserving your resources, you can make a real difference by <b>donating</b> that money to
        charities that help people meet their practical physical needs.\n\n

        What if, instead of <b>paying</b> for and <b>wasting</b> clean drinking water, we used only
        what we <b>need</b> and helped others get <b>access to clean water</b>?\n\n

        What if, instead of <b>paying</b> for food that we ultimately didn\'t end up eating (or let go bad),
        we bought only what we needed and gave the left over money to <b>starving</b> people on our streets
        or across the world?\n\n

        <i>\"There is plenty on this earth to suit our needs, but there will never ever be enough to
        <b>satisfy our greed</b>.\"</i>\n
        -Jenny and Tyler , \"Love Through Me\"\n\n

        Let\'s not be greedy with the resources around us. These things take <b>lifestyle changes</b> and
        are not easy, but we can change lives from what would have been our <b>overflow</b>.
        You don\'t have to be rich by American standards
        to give to others.\n\n <b>Turn your usage savings into money to make a real difference, starting now</b>.</string>
